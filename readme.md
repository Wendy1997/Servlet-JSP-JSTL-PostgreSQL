Hi everyone,

In this project, i just made a CRUD system using Java Servlet for the backend, JSP + JSTL for the frontend and include the PostgreSQL for the database system.

To use this project, please import the dependecies of JSTL, PostgreSQL, and JBDC at BlibliMovies/web/WEB-INF/lib especially if you use IntelliJ.

And then for the SQL you can insert the table as sql that i just made at Files/dump.sql. Just import it to intellij or psql. And set the postgre database at BlibliMovies/web/include/head.jsp

Good Luck ;)
